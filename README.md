### “Trust Is Everything”: The Vendor's View

_As a longtime darknet vendor, stats mean nothing without trust. I only use markets where admin care about security, escrow, and keeping scammers out. Right now, the **We The North** market is the only place I do business. The Canadian focus makes transactions fast and honest—every deal is protected, and the rules keep things professional. You pay in BTC or XMR, rates set in CAD, so there's zero confusion. Vendor bond is $300 CAD, with flat 5% fees and over 5,000 listings — only serious players can join._<br>

### “Darknet Market Stats Don’t Lie”: The Data Guy

_If you watch actual **darknet market stats**, numbers paint a clear picture. After the 2021-2024 enforcement wave killed off giants like Hydra and Genesis, market revenue dropped from $3.1 billion to just over $2 billion. Yet, markets like **Nexus** have stayed online and active, defending millions in trades thanks to robust security and decentralized operations._

_Stats show one thing: when a market stays up, people trust it—and more vendors and buyers join. No marketplace survives years without real reliability and protections._
